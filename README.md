# ros2india

This repository serves as a collection of various **ROS1** and **ROS2** projects. Each project is added as a Git submodule, allowing modular access and maintenance. This guide provides instructions on how to clone the repository with submodules, manage individual projects, and contribute to the collection.

## Overview

The **ros2india** repository contains a variety of **ROS1** and **ROS2** projects, each housed in a separate directory. Each project is a standalone repository, added as a **Git submodule**, enabling easy management and modular development. You can clone and work with each project independently or with the whole collection.

Some projects currently included are:
- **NavRover**: A 4-wheeled rover capable of teleoperation, mapping, and autonomous navigation.
- (Add your other ROS1/ROS2 projects here.)

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the **ros2india** repository along with all its submodules (i.e., the individual ROS1/ROS2 projects), use the `--recurse-submodules` flag:

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hwjalapeno/ros2india.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd ros2india
   ```

3. If you have already cloned the repository without the submodules, you can initialize and update the submodules manually:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

## Working with Submodules

Each project inside **ros2india** is included as a submodule. Hereâ€™s how you can manage and interact with the individual projects.

### Adding a New Project

To add a new ROS1/ROS2 project to this repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root of the **ros2india** repository:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ros2india
   ```

2. Add the project repository as a submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/username/project-repo.git path/to/project-directory
   ```
   Replace:
   - `https://github.com/username/project-repo.git` with the repository URL of the project.
   - `path/to/project-directory` with the desired path within the **ros2india** directory.

3. Commit the changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added [Project Name] as a submodule"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Updating Submodules

To pull the latest changes from a specific submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

To update all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
